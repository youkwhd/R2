Reaction Rolls (R2)
===================

Discord bot for managing reaction roles.

R2 is still on the early development stage, this means there
would be breaking changes in further updates.

Quick Start
-----------

This blindly assumes that you already have Go installed.

Specify your discord bot token:

    echo "YOUR-DISCORD-BOT-TOKEN" > .R2TOK

There is no support for OTP Tokens at the moment.

You can go to https://discord.com/developers/applications in
order to create a new discord application (bot).

Specify your discord bot/app id:

    echo "YOUR-DISCORD-APP-ID" > .R2AID

Specify your development server ID (optional):

    echo "YOUR-GUILD-SERVER-ID" > .R2SRV

After completing the above instructions, you can run the bot via
a shell script:

    ./rrolls

Database
--------

SQLite3 is the only great candidate option for an SQL database.

How to wipe the data/db.json data? just empty the file:

    echo -n > data/db.json

TODOs
-----

- Threading
- Maybe use SQLite3
